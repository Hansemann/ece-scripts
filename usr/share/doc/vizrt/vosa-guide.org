* Installation of VOSA package


** Requirements:
- kvm or qemu-kvm
- genisoimage
- nc
- tunctl
- sudo access to kvm (or the more usual, which is to run vosa as root...)
- a bridged network

This installation will:

- download an UEC image and kernel
- create 10 tap interfaces (or less) (see below)
- create ten "tap*.availablenetwork" fileis (where * is a number between 0 and 10)
  in /var/run/vizrt/vosa/ signifying the names of the tap interfaces that can be used.
- write (exclusively?) access to /var/run/vizrt/vosa/


** Setup
Install the vosa command itself and its required libraries

   : ln -s $PWD/usr/bin/vosa /usr/bin/vosa
   : ln -s $PWD/usr/share/vizrt/ /usr/share/vizrt

Initialize it:

   : vosa init

Download an Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud image to use as the base OS

   : vosa -v oneiric download

Make a bridge, br0 or something (outside the scope of this document)

make 10 tap interfaces and make them known to vosa (this probably needs to happen every boot...

   : for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do
   :   tap=$(tunctl -b)
   :   touch /var/run/vizrt/vosa/$tap.availablenetwork
   :   brctl addif br0 $tap
   :   ifconfig $tap up 0.0.0.0
   : done

Define a virtual machine:

   : mkdir /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm &&
   : cp /etc/vizrt/vosa/skeleton/* /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm/

Configure these files (they're well documented)

   : vi /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm/*

Make sure your IP and MAC addresses are unique

Finally, enable and install your virtual machine:

   : vosa -i my-first-vm enable install

When it's done you can SSH into the system:

   : ssh -F /var/lib/vizrt/vosa/my-first-vm/ssh.conf root@guest
