* Backups

** Multimedia archive
The other place were you've got actual content, is in the multimedia
archive. This, typically live on a host called nfs1 (with a mirror on
nfs2) and a backup of the exports directory  should suffice. This is
the directory in which all the NFS exported directories reside.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
<%= trail_nfs_master_host %>:/var/exports  
#+END_SRC

It's recommended that the backup isn't done using the NFS mount on one
of the other hosts using this NFS server, but instead target the
nfs1's /var/exports directory directly as the backup tools would
access any server directory.
