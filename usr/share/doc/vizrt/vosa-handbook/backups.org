* Backups

** DB backups
If you've told ece-install to set up daily backups, there will be a
cron scripts set up which create backups.

Part of the name of the cron script is the name of your DB schema, so
the default location of the cron script is:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/etc/cron.daily/ece5db-backup  
#+END_SRC

And it'll put its backups in
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/var/backups/escenic  
#+END_SRC

All these are overridable, see the ece-install guide for further
details.
