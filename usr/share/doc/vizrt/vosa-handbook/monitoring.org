* Monitoring

On a VOSA system you have several tools to aid you in getting an
overview of how your system is doing, how it is configured and how it
has been behaving from its inception till the present.

** system-info

*** On the Command Line
On any VOSA host, you can execute the command system-info. If you
execute this command as root, you better pass a parameter to tell it
the user under which ECE, EAE and the Search instance are running as
(typically "escenic"):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# system-info -u escenic  
#+END_SRC

*** In the Web Browser
All VOSA hosts also has a (maximum) one minute old HTML report from
system-info running on port 5678. So for any VOSA habitat, you can
access these reports like this:
- http://my-presentation-server:5678/
- http://my-editorial-server:5678/
- http://my-import-server:5678/
- http://my-nfs-server:5678/
- http://my-db-server:5678/
- http://my-stats-server:5678/

Here's a screenshot of the system-info report running on http://my-presentation-server:5678/:

** Hugin

** Munin
Each VOSA habitat has its own Munin installation where you can see the
trending of your site. I.e. how it has been behaving the last days,
weeks and months.

If we assume your monitoring server is called "my-monitoring-server",
the address to your munin is: http://my-monitoring-server/munin/
