* Updating the Search Server

When updating the search server, you might want to reconfigure the
ECE instance(s) that use the search server you're updating. To do
this, you can use the Component Browser in the escenic-admin
interface.

For instance, let's say you're upgrading the search server for
<%= my-editorial-server %> and want it to temporarily use
<%= my-import-server %>'s search instance.

First, go to:
http://<%= my-editorial-server %>:8080/escenic-admin/browser/Global/com/escenic/webservice/search/DelegatingSearchEngine?property=solrURI

Then, change the value from:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
http://localhost:8081/solr/select	  
#+END_SRC

to

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
http://<%= my-import-server %>:8081/solr/select	  
#+END_SRC
