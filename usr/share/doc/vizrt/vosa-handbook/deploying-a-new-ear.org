** Deploying a new EAR file
In the examples here, we have a build server on builder.example.com
where we build EARs for the the tomato website.

*** Deploying a new EAR file for an ECE instance
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
torstein@control:~$ sudo ssh escenic@pres1 \
  ece \
    -i engine1 \
    --uri http://builder.example.com/tomato/releases/tomato-trunk-rev4121-2012-07-05_1524.ear \
    deploy
[ece#engine-engine1] Deploying http://builder.example.com/tomato/releases/tomato-trunk-rev4121-2012-07-05_1524.ear on engine1 ...
[ece#engine-engine1] Deploying /var/cache/escenic/tomato-trunk-rev4121-2012-07-05_1524.ear on tomcat ...
[ece#engine-engine1] Deployment white list active, only deploying: eb escenic-admin indexer-webservice
[ece#engine-engine1] Deployment state file updated: /var/lib/escenic/engine1.state
#+END_SRC


*** Deploying a new EAR file for a search instance
The search instance is special in that you have to specify the type
parameter. Apart from this, the command is identical. You'll see that
the search instance has a different deployment white list than that of
the ECE instance above.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
torstein@control:~$ sudo ssh escenic@pres1 \
  ece \
    -i search1 \
    -t search \
    --uri http://builder.example.com/tomato/releases/tomato-trunk-rev4121-2012-07-05_1524.ear \
    deploy
