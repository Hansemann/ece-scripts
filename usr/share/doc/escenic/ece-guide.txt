1 TAB completion 
-----------------
The ece script offers TAB completion, given that your version of BASH
supports this and that you have enabled it (some distributions hasn't
turned on BASH completion per default).

1.1 Completing ece commands 
============================
You will find yourself using this regularly, both for speed, but also
to remember all the different options and their correct wording:



  $ ece TAB TAB
  applog      deploy      log         start       threaddump  
  assemble    help        outlog      status      update      
  clean       kill        restart     stop        versions




The commands are all described in detail in "ece help"

1.2 Completing types of servers the ece scripts can operate on 
===============================================================


  $ ece -t TAB TAB
  analysis  engine    rmi-hub   search




1.3 Completing the publication resources available 
===================================================
The ece script can update the publication resources for a given
publication.

To help selecting the correct publication resource, you can make ece
list and complete the available resource names:



  $ ece -p mypub -r TAB TAB
  content-type   image-version  layout-group   
  feature        layout         menu
