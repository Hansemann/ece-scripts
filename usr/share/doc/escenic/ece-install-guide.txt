1 Supported Operating Systems 
------------------------------
For the best experience, run this script on Debian Squeeze (or newer),
the latest Ubuntu LTS or most other Debian based operating systems,
but it should work without any problems on any Unix like system that
has a recent version of BASH.

1.1 Debian based operating systems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If running on a Debian based operating system, ece-install will take
care of installing all required third party software, such as database
& caching server.

1.2 Other GNU/Linux and Unix systems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're installing on another Linux or Unix system, you must first
make sure that these 3rd party components are installed. ece-install
will tell you which ones it cannot find and tell you to install these,
so you can simply run it to find out which ones you need.

You may also look inside the ece-install script for all calls to the
'assert\_pre\_prequesite' method and you'll get a list of the binaries
ece-install assumes are present.

2 A Note on Running ece-install On Non-GNU/Linux Systems 
---------------------------------------------------------
Please note, it's assumed that the OS uses GNU's tools, i.e. find, cp
& tar. If you're running a system which has a different set of core
tools, such as any of the BSDs (including Mac OS X) or Solaris, make
sure that GNU's tools take precedence in the command PATH offered to
ece-install.

3 Downloading the ece-install Script 
-------------------------------------
The ece-install script can be downloaded from:
[https://raw.github.com/skybert/ece-scripts/master/usr/sbin/ece-install]
or be downloaded together with the other ece-scripts using git:


  $ git clone git@github.com:skybert/ece-scripts.git


4 Running the ece-install Script 
---------------------------------
You must run the script as the root user.  If you start the script as
a regular user, it will complain:


  [ece-install] You must be root when running ece-install

To become root on Ubuntu based systems and Mac OS X, do:


  $ sudo su

On all other Unix like system, do:


  $ su


You will need access to [http://technet.escenic.com] and put these
credentials in the root user's $HOME/.ece-install.conf, normally this
means /root/.ece-install.conf, the script will also tell you this if
you forget to provide such a configuration file:


  [ece-install] /root/.ece-install.conf doesn't exist, I cannot live without it :-(


As for the technet credentials, the script will also tell you if it
cannot find what it's looking for:


  [ece-install] Be sure to set technet_user and technet_password
  [ece-install] in /root/.ece-install.conf


The minimum .ece-install.conf file is thus:


  technet_user=<user>
  technet_password=<password>


If you're installing WF as well, you'll need additional credentials
for this, see the Widget Framwork section below, and if you want to
runn a fully automatic install without any user interaction, you'll
need to specify some FAI specific parameters, see the FAI section
below. 

With the configuration file in place, you're now ready to run it:


  # bash ece-install [-v|--verbose]


ece-install will try to "fail fast", exiting as soon as it detects an
error during its execution:


  [ece-install-1] The command [cd /does/not/exist] FAILED, exiting :-(
  [ece-install-1] See /var/log/ece-install.log for further details.


As a last resort, if something goes astray with the script, and the
log file cannot give you enough clues, the ultimate way of debugging
this is to run the BASH interpreter with the -x flag:


  # bash -x ece-install


Here you can see everything that BASH does when running the script,
how the wildcard variables expand and so on. Normally, having a tail
on /var/log/ece-install.log should be sufficient, though.

5 Available Server Profiles 
----------------------------
When starting the script, it will ask you which server profile you
want to install:


  Hi, which server profile do you wish to install?
  
     1 - All in one, full stack on one host, suitable for dev & test environments
     2 - Editorial (publication) server
     3 - Presentation server (ECE + memcached).
     4 - Database server
     5 - Cache server (cache and web server)
     6 - RMI hub
     7 - Search server (Solr + indexer-webapp)
     8 - Install Widget Framework.
     9 - Create a new publication based on WF if available, ECE/clean-demo if not
     10 - A monitoring server (web server + Munin gatherer)
     11 - Restore from backup (DB, data files, binaries, conf & publications)
  
  Select 1-11 and press ENTER
  Your choice [1]>

5.1 Common for All Server Profiles 
===================================
The script will install a Munin node on the host. It will also
install the Escenic specific Munin plugins on hosts where there are
any Escenic server components.

5.2 Common for Editorial, Presentation and Search Instances 
============================================================

5.2.1 Sun Java 6 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.2.2 Apache Tomcat application server 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Compression of textual content (previously, this was typically set
  up with Apache and its mod\_deflate module).
- pooling set up tweaked for high read/write performance.
- proper logging configuration directing solr messages to its own log.
- routing information in the cookies
- application server access log

5.2.3 Basic Escenic Nursery configuration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basic Nursery configuration is taken care of for you, including RMI,
  database, search and application server/URIs. 

5.2.4 APR, native library for optimal Tomcat I/O performance 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.2.5 Escenic Assembly environment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The reason why ece-install sets this up on each host, is to make the
installation process as smooth as possible. The assembly environment
may be removed after the installation if you want to.

5.2.6 Database driver 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.2.7 Compression of content 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was was previously accomplished by having a web server in fron t
of the application server (or cache server if you used ESI). A typical
system architecture would contain Apache with mod\_deflate. However,
this is no longer necessary as Varnish can handles ESI parsing of
compressed content (and many other things that we before needed Apache
for). Thus, we'll let the application server do the compression for us
now.

5.3 Profile - Full Stack on One Host 
=====================================
This profile is suitable for developers and admins wanting to set up a
test environment. It will install the full stack including caching
server, application server, ECE, assembly host, database, Widget
Framework, as well as creating a publication for you.

For further details on each of the different server components, see
the different profile descriptions bellow.


5.4 Profile - Editorial Server (Publication Server) 
====================================================
Will set up a typical editorial server (often referred to as the
publication server in Escenic literature).

5.5 Profile - Presentation Server 
==================================
This will set up a typical presentation server:
- Memcached, distributed memory cache
- Deployment setup to only deploy escenic-admin and the
  publication(s).

5.6 Profile - Database Server 
==============================
If ece-install is run on a support version of Debian or Ubuntu, this
will install the excellent Percona distribution of MySQL with their
set of high performance patches.

If not, MySQL or Percona must be installed in advance.

Given that the mysqld is install, this profile will download all the
Escenic components and install the ECE database schema based from the
SQL files contained inside the distribution bundles. To accomplish
this, the script will make a call to drop-and-create-ecedb in the same
directory as the ece-intall script itself.

The script will fail by itself if the DB already exists:


  [ece-install] Setting up the ECE database schema ...
  ERROR 1007 (HY000) at line 1: Can't create database 'ece5db'; database exists
  ERROR 1050 (42S01) at line 2: Table 'DBChangeLog' already exists
  [ece-install] running tables FAILED, exiting :-(


5.7 Profile - Cache Server 
===========================
If ece-install is run on a support version of Debian or Ubuntu, it
will install the latest Varnish 3.0 caching server from the Varnish
APT repository.

If ece-install is run on a different platform, the admin must install
Varnish 3.x prior to running ece-install.

The script will configure Varnish for a typical Escenic site:
- it will set up the cache server on port 80
- will set up an access control lists of IPs which may access the
  privileged web applications such as /escenic-admin, /escenic and
  /webservice.

  ece-install will also add the host from which you connect, making
  sure that if you've SSH-ed into the server to conduct the install,
  you'll automatically be included in the "staff" ACL and can access
  all the web applications without editing these ACLs (or disabling
  security as many does).

- will set up sticky sessions/session binding
- will set up a backend cluster and allow the user to enter the
  different backend servers that will serve the web site.
- will set up configuration to strip away cookies from static
  resources, such as CSS, JS and pictures.
- will install the nginx web server for serving static content and
  will configure Varnish accordingly. This will be very useful for
  Adactus servers wanting to pull content from your ECEs.

TBD:
- If run on a Linux platform, the script will tweak the kernel
  parameters for optimal TCP handling for a web facing server.
- let the /munin run through on port 80, requiring the connecting IPs
  to be in the staff network ACL, defined in the Varnish
  configuration. 

5.8 Profile - Install Widget Framework 
=======================================
You'll need a user name and password for accessing the
repo.escenic.com Maven repository. You should get these credentials
when you bought Widget Framework. If you for some reason do not have
these, please contact support@escenic.com. 

If you don't have these ready in your .ece-install.conf, ece-install will
complain:


  [ece-install] Be sure to set wf_user and wf_password in /root/.ece-install.conf
  [ece-install] If you don't have these, please contact support@escenic.com

5.9 Profile - Create Publication 
=================================
This profile will create a publication for you, only asking you the
name of the publication and which ECE instance to use for its
creation.

This installation profile will base the publication on the Widget
Framework if its present on the system, if not, ECE's clean demo WAR
is used as a basis.  

5.10 Profile - Monitoring Server 
=================================
This will install a Munin gatherer and web server. The latter for
accessing the reports generated by the former.

TBD: This profile will also install the Nagios interface for
monitoring the different nodes. 

5.11 Profile - Restoring from backup 
=====================================
ece-install can restore from a backup made by the ece script:


  $ ece -i <instance> backup


As stated in the ece guide, this backup may contain (depending on
what's available on the host where it's run):
- database dump of the instance
- data files (pictures, video files and so on). This is often referred
  to as the "multimedia archive" in Escenic literature.
- ECE, cache and web server configuration
- Escenic software

5.12 Running interactively 
===========================

5.12.1 Start ece-install and choose the Option, "Restore from backup" 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  # ece-install


5.12.2 Select Which Backup to Restore 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



  [ece-install-5] From which dataset do you wish to backup?
      1 - engine-dev1-backup-2011-10-10.tar.gz
      2 - engine-dev1-backup-2011-10-11.tar.gz
  [ece-install-5] Enter the number next to the tarball, from 1 to 2
  Your choice [1]>


The ece script mentioned above will create backups in


  /var/backups/escenic

and the ece-install script will hence expect to find them here.

5.12.3 Choose What to Restore 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  [ece-install-12] Which part of the system do you wish to restore?
      1 - The database
      2 - The Solr and ECE data files (multimedia archive)
      3 - The ECE configuration files
      4 - The Escenic and Tomcat software binaries + publication templates
  Your choice [1]> 2


5.12.4 Sit Back and Watch ece-install Restore the Data for You 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  [ece-install-13] Restoring the Solr & ECE data files on ubiquitous ...
  [ece-install-21] - The installation is now complete! It took 0d 0h 0m 20s
  [ece-install] Successfully restored Solr & ECE data files
  [ece-install] from backup:  engine-dev1-backup-2011-10-12.tar.gz
  [ece-install] Check /var/lib/escenic to verify they're all there


5.13 Running in FAI mode 
=========================
If you're running in FAI mode, you can choose between these settings
to decide what to restore and where to find the backup file to
restore from:

  Parameter                          Default   Description                                         
 ----------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------
  fai\_restore\_all                        0   Restore everything found in the backup file         
  fai\_restore\_db                         0   Install the DB server & restore its contents        
  fai\_restore\_data\_files                0   Restore the Solr & ECE data files                   
  fai\_restore\_configuration              0   Restore the Solr & ECE configuration files          
  fai\_restore\_software\_binaries         0   Restore the Escenic and Apache Tomcat software      
  fai\_restore\_from\_file                ""   The .tar.gz produced by "ece -i <instance> backup"  

For example, to restore everything possible from a given tarball, you
need this in your .ece-install.conf:


  fai_enabled=1
  
  fai_restore_from_backup=1
  fai_restore_all=1
  fai_restore_from_file=/var/backups/escenic/engine-dev1-backup-2011-10-10.tar.gz


5.14 Data security 
===================
You should take heed when running restore, so that you're not
restoring a system which you didn't want to change (yes, this mishap
does happen).

The ece-install script will help you a bit on the way, but the final
responsibility always lies with you as the user. 

If you're trying to restore the DB and the ECE schema already exists,
the restore will fail:


  [ece-install-8] Restoring the database contents on ubiquitous ...
  [ece-install-24] Selecting the most recent database dump ece5db-2011-10-10.sql.gz
  ERROR 1007 (HY000) at line 1: Can't create database 'ece5db'; database exists
  ERROR 1050 (42S01) at line 25: Table '`ece5db`.`AccessControlList`' already exists
  [ece-install-24] The command [restoring from var/backups/escenic/ece5db-2011-10-10.sql.gz] FAILED, exiting :-(
  [ece-install-24] See /var/log/ece-install.log for further details.

6 Full Automatic Install (FAI) 
-------------------------------
The ece-install script has support for doing a full automatic install
(FAI). You can only install one profile at a time. The profiles are
the parameters with "install" in their name, such as:


  fai_editor_install


6.1 Overview of All FAI Parameters 
===================================
The ece-install script understands for the following settings in the
$HOME/.ece-install.conf file of the root user:

  Parameter                                   Default   Description                                    
 ----------------------------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------
  fai\_all\_install                                 0   Install all components on your server.

  fai\_editor\_port                              8080   HTTP port of the editor instance               
  fai\_editor\_shutdown                          8005   Shutdown port of the editor instance           
  fai\_enabled                                      0   Whether or not to run ece-install in FAI mode  
  fai\_public\_host\_name            ${HOSTNAME}:8080   The public address for your website            
  fai\_presentation\_install                        0   Install the presentation server profile        
  fai\_monitoring\_server\_install                  0   Install the monitoring server profile.         
  fai\_monitoring\_server\_ip               127.0.0.1   The IP of the monitoring server.               
  fai\_presentation\_name                        web1   Name of the presentation server instance

  fai\_publication\_create                          0   Create a new publication                       
  fai\_publication\_name                        mypub   Name of the publication                        
  fai\_publication\_use\_instance                dev1   Name of local instance to use for creation     
  fai\_rmi\_install                                 0   Install RMI hub profile                        
  fai\_search\_name                           search1   Name of the search instance                    
  fai\_search\_port                              8080   HTTP port of the search instance               
  fai\_search\_shutdown                          8005   Shutdown port of the search instance           
  fai\_wf\_install                                  0   Install Widget Framework profile               

As you've probably have guessed, 0 means "false" and 1 means "true" :-)

6.2 Examples 
=============

6.2.1 Installing an Editorial Server & Create a Publication 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To automatically install an editorial server and create a publication
called "jollygood", the minimal configuration in .ece-install.conf
would be:



  fai_enabled=1
  fai_editor_install=1
  fai_publication_create=1
  fai_publication_name=jollygood


6.2.2 Installing Two Presentation Servers On a Single Host 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you wish to only install two presentation servers called "web1" and
"web2" on your host, you will first run ece-install with:


  fai_enabled=1
  fai_presentation_install=1
  fai_presentation_name=web1


And then re-issue ece-install with the following configuration:


  fai_enabled=1
  fai_presentation_install=1
  fai_presentation_name=web2
  fai_presentation_port=8081
  fai_presentation_shutdown=8105

Notice that this configuration has some extra options since the
previous run of ece-install could run with the default settings,
whereas the second one needs to override these.


6.3 Verifying That the Script Is Running In FAI Mode 
=====================================================
When FAI is enabled, ece-install will report:


  [ece-install] Full Automatic Install (FAI) enabled.
  [ece-install] All user input will be read from /root/.ece-install.conf


7 Running More Than One Installation Process 
---------------------------------------------
If the script believes there's already an ece-intall process running,
it will abort:


  [ece-install] There's already one ece-install process running. If you believe
  [ece-install] this is wrong, e.g. if a previous run of ece-install was aborted
  [ece-install] before it completed, you may delete /var/run/ece-install.pid and
  [ece-install] run ece-install again.


8 Re-running ece-install (and How To Speed It Up) 
--------------------------------------------------
Although the initial thought behind ece-install, is to run it on a
clean system to get up and running as soon as possible. However, you
may want to re-run ece-install on the same host, for instance to add
another instance of ECE, set up Widget Framework or create another
publication.

ece-install has a number of features which will try to minimise the
time it takes to run it on consecutive runs. If running on Debian
based systems, it will check if you already have installed
pre-requisite 3rd party libraries and only if any are missing will it
ask the package manager to fetch it.

Likewise, ece-install will see if the Escenic artifacts or application
server that you need are already present in the /tmp/ece-downloads
folder, and only download the missing ones (if any).

To get a list of the artifacts it'll pull from
[http://technet.escenic.com] and http://tomcat.apache.org search for the
following variables:
- technet\_download\_list
- wf\_download\_list
- tomcat\_download

9 Overview of File Paths Used by the ece-install script 
--------------------------------------------------------
There are of course other paths involved when setting up your system,
but these should be the most interesting ones.

10 Assumptions 
---------------

10.1 /etc/esecenic is shared 
=============================
It's assumed that the /etc/escenic directory is either on a shared
file system or rsync-ed among the hosts that are running the ECE
instances (the exception being database and cache servers).
 

11 Uninstalling Everything That the ece-install Set Up 
-------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: this is potentially dangerous as some of these components may
be used by other pieces of software you have running on your
host. However, this may be useful if you're installing a clean
environment and want to e.g. undo your previous install to install a
different profile.

Open the ece-install script and look for the "un\_install\_ece"
function, it has copy and pastable commands for undoing most/all
things set up by the script.


12 Example Output FAI 
----------------------
The ece-install will often be run in FAI mode where all the settings
are read from ~/.ece-install.conf. Given the following entries in this
file: 


  technet_user=apples
  technet_password=andoranges
  wf_user=foo
  wf_password=bar
  
  fai_enabled=1
  fai_all_install=1


All the different components described in this guide are installed on
the host that runs the install script.

The following output is produced from ece-install:
CANNOT INCLUDE FILE ~/tmp/ece-install.out
