Guide for the /usr/bin/ece Script

* TAB completion
The ece script offers TAB completion, given that your version of BASH
supports this and that you have enabled it (some distributions hasn't
turned on BASH completion per default).

** Completing ece commands
You will find yourself using this regularly, both for speed, but also
to remember all the different options and their correct wording:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece TAB TAB
applog      deploy      log         start       threaddump  
assemble    help        outlog      status      update      
clean       kill        restart     stop        versions 
#+END_SRC
The commands are all described in detail in "ece help"

** Completing types of servers the ece scripts can operate on
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -t TAB TAB
analysis  engine    rmi-hub   search 
#+END_SRC

** Completing the publication resources available
The ece script can update the publication resources for a given
publication.

To help selecting the correct publication resource, you can make ece
list and complete the available resource names:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -p mypub -r TAB TAB
content-type   image-version  layout-group   
feature        layout         menu
#+END_SRC
